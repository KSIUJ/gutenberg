# Introduction
Welcome to the documentation of the Gutenberg project!

The home of the Gutenberg project is its GitHub repository: [KSIUJ/gutenberg](https://github.com/KSIUJ/gutenberg).
It hosts the project's source code, the source of this book and the list of
[issues and planned features](https://github.com/KSIUJ/gutenberg/issues).

## Book structure
This book is divided into two sections **Admin documentation** and **Internals**.

The **Admin documentation** section is intended for system administrators who manage a self-hosted Gutenberg instance.

The **API documentation** section documents Gutenberg's REST API and Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) implementation.

The **Internals** section is mainly intended for Gutenberg's contributors.
It explains the codebase structure, describes the design choices and their rationale.
It also describes the suggested implementation and design considerations for planned features.
